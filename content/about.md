<p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 first-letter:text-7xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:text-gray-900 dark:first-letter:text-gray-100 first-letter:mr-3 first-letter:float-left">I have been developing solutions using technology for over 3 years. I started developing web platforms, libraries and other products. From an early age, while still in college, I collaborated with scientific initiation projects and developed personal projects that solved real problems. If you need collaboration on an open source project, please contact me by phone or email, I will be happy to help. :) <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/kawhan" class="font-medium text-blue-600 underline dark:text-blue-500 hover:no-underline">Linkedin</a>.</p>

            My journey with technology started very early, I had a very simple contact in 2012 with python when I was trying to create a solution to solve a problem I faced in MMO RPG games (I wanted to earn more money to buy items). At first the contact was not good, my computer almost wouldn't let me run the code.

        <p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
            Today, over 10 years old, after learning about technology and becoming interested in a degree, I had contact with several programming languages (I had less time to try to earn some money in MMOs), I have already worked for 2 years as a developer on several fronts front-end, backend and desktop and I'm delving deeper into the backend.

<h2 class="text-4xl font-bold dark:text-white">Hobbies</h2>
<p class="mb-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">When I'm not programming, you can find me adventuring in other worlds (Lost Ark, Path of Exile, WoW), trying to make my barbarian as barbaric as possible. I really like reading manga and I'm a technology enthusiast, my hobby is using all my knowledge to solve problems (you need help, like "Severino" -> slang for handyman in Brazil xD).</p>
